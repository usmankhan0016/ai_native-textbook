# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook for **Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics**! This course will take you from ROS 2 fundamentals to building intelligent humanoid robots with Vision-Language-Action capabilities.

## What You'll Learn

This textbook covers four main modules:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
**Weeks 3-5** | Difficulty: Beginner

Master the fundamentals of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the industry-standard middleware for robotics. You'll learn:
- ROS 2 architecture and communication patterns
- Nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Package management and launch files
- URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoid robots

### Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation
**Weeks 6-8** | Difficulty: Intermediate

Build realistic digital twins of humanoid robots using Gazebo and Unity simulation platforms.

### Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac Platform
**Weeks 9-11** | Difficulty: Intermediate

Leverage NVIDIA Isaac Sim for synthetic data generation and Isaac ROS for accelerated robotics applications.

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Robotics
**Weeks 12-14** | Difficulty: Advanced

Integrate multimodal AI models (Whisper, GPT-4, Vision Transformers) for intelligent robot control.
